# How to import a Trados term base file (.sdltb) into memoQ translator pro

It is not possible to import an .sdltb file into memoQ translator pro. However, you can convert the .sdltb file into one of the formats supported by memoQ (.csv, .txt, .txv, .tmx, .xls, .xlsx, .xml, .tbx). One program that you can use to do that is [Glossary Converter](https://www.cerebus.de/glossaryconverter/), which can generate Excel files from .sdltb ones.

It is also possible to import a term base as part of a package file (see [here](https://adgut1509.github.io/ProjektZaliczeniowy/docs/parent4/UGchild1/grandchild1.html)).
