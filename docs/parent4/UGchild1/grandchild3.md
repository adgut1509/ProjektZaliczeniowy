# How to open a Trados term base file (.sdltb) in MemoQ

It is not possible to open an .sdltb file in MemoQ. However, you can convert the .sdltb file into one of the formats supported by MemoQ (.csv, .txt, .txv, .tmx, .xls, .xlsx, .xml, .tbx).

It is possible to import MemoQ as part of a package file (see [link]).
