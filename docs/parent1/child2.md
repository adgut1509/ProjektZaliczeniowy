# **What are term bases in CAT tools**

In CAT tools, termbases are databases that consist of pairs of multilingual terms stored in a list. They work like glossaries - you can access them when your translation requires you to do so.

Term bases often include specific words and phrases that the you are *required* to translate in a particular way.
