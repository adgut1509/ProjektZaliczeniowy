Now you should see the requirements to publish and record a study. By default, the study design is valid, and you are its owner. To fulfil the requirements, first, click on the icon next to **Description: No keyword(s), No affiliation**.

In this section, you need to do two things:
1. Add at least one keyword. To do it, click on the keyword that you want to add in the drop-down menu in the **Keywords** section.
2. In the **Author or Affiliation** section, write your name or the name of the institution you are affiliated with.

Here, you can also set the minimum and maximum duration of your study and give it a description. However, that is not obligatory.
