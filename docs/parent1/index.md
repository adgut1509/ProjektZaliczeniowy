# **What is a CAT tool**

CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) tools are software used that help a human translator translate texts from one language to another. They have substantially changed the work of a translator. CAT tools also make it easier for translators to manage, edit, and submit their projects.

# **What does a CAT tool do**

When the human translator inputs text in the source language into a CAT tool, it divides it into segments. Then, as the segments get translated, it saves the parts of the source and target texts.

The process step-by-step:

1. The human translator inputs the source text into a CAT tool.
2. The CAT tool extracts translatable parts of the text.
3. The CAT tool divides the text into segments.
