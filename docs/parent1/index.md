# **What is a CAT tool**

CAT (Computer-Assisted Translation) tools are software used that help a human translator translate texts from one language to another. They have substantially changed the work of a translator. CAT tools also make it easier for translators to manage, edit, and submit their projects.

# **What does a CAT tool do**

When the human translator inputs text in the source language into a CAT tool, it divides it into segments. Then, as the segments get translated, it saves the parts of the source and target texts.

The process step-by-step:

1. The human translator inputs the source text into a CAT tool.
2. The CAT tool extracts translatable parts of the text.
3. The CAT tool divides the text into segments.
4. The CAT tool displays the source and target texts side by side.
5. The human translator inputs their translations into the target segments.
6. The CAT tool saves the part of the source text and its translation in a [translation memory](https://adgut1509.github.io/ProjektZaliczeniowy/docs/parent1/child2.html)
